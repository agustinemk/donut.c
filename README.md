# üç© donut.c
*A donut generated by revolving a circle in three-dimensional space about an axis that is coplanar with the circle.*

This code is an implementation of a simple 3D graphics program that creates an ASCII art animation of a spinning torus (donut shape). The torus is created using mathematical rotations in 3D space, and then projected onto a 2D screen using a simple perspective projection formula. The frames are displayed on the console using ASCII characters, where different characters are used to represent different levels of brightness (luminance) calculated from the surface normal of the torus.
